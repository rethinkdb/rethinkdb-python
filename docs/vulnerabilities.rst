Reporting vulnerabilities
-------------------------

What is vulnerability?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability is a cyber-security term that refers to a flaw in a system
that can leave it open to attack. The vulnerability may also refer to any
type of weakness in a computer system itself, in a set of procedures, or
in anything that leaves information security exposed to a threat.
